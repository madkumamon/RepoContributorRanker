# RepoContributorRanker

The development team wants to track who did the most work each week for bragging rights. Using the GitHub API, create a maintainable API or interface that exposes a scorecard that shows the top contributors on a single GitHub repository in the past week. Assume the team uses GitHub flow and that the team only cares about pull request related events.

## Score Guidelines:

- Pull Request: 12 points
- Pull Request Comment: 1 point
- Pull Request Review: 3 points

## Notes:

- Ruby is preferred.
- Possibility to choose any org/repo you wish.
- In-memory storage is perfectly fine, but weâ€™d love to at least see a sketch of how you would design a schema around this problem and which storage technology you would choose, assuming that the team wants to store results long-term.
- Maybe you can show us some unit testing skills for written business logic.

## Rails Web Interface
